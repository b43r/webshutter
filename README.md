# WebShutter

WebShutter implements a simple webserver and REST API to controll GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. WebShutter runs as a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) on Windows 10 IOT.

## Getting started

You need a Raspberry Pi (at least model 2). Install Windows 10 IoT Core (see https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/iot-core/tutorials/tutorials).

## Hardware wiring

I used a [breakout board from Seed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-Breakout-Board-v1-0-p-2410.html) which can be screwed ontop of the Raspberry using spacers.
